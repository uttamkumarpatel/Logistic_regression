# 🚀 Logistic Regression Model

Welcome to the **Logistic Regression Model** repository! This project demonstrates the implementation of logistic regression for classification tasks using Python. 📊 Logistic Regression is a fundamental algorithm in machine learning used for binary and multi-class classification problems. It applies the concept of probability to predict categorical outcomes.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/logistic_regression.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd logistic_regression
   ```
3. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   env\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   ```
4. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook logistic_regression.ipynb
   ```

## 📊 Model Performance
The model performance is evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy 🎯** - Measures the percentage of correct predictions.
- **Precision 🎯** - Evaluates the quality of positive predictions.
- **Recall 🎯** - Measures the model's ability to capture positive instances.
- **F1 Score 🎯** - A balance between precision and recall.
- **ROC-AUC Score 📈** - Assesses the model's ability to distinguish between classes.
